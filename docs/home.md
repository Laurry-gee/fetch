> Another command line http test tool

Maintain the api test cases via git and pure text

We want to test the APIs via http requests and assert the responses, postman & newman are easy for this.

But when you got more than maybe 50+ cases, the exported json file shared with your team is huge, maybe more than 10000 lines, it's hard to maintain in the future.

So, here is the httptest

- all in text(.toml/.yaml/.json)
- easy to create/modify/copy and delete
- maintained by git
- run fast
